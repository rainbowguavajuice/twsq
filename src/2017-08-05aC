AidenEldritch:
I now really want to write a song titled "segfault to your heart"
AidenEldritch:
It's a love song about a guarded person
AidenEldritch:
You get close to them, try to gain access to their heart
AidenEldritch:
But it's restricted, so you segfault
AidenEldritch:
It's very sad
AidenEldritch:
And doesn't rhyme
AidenEldritch:
Because wtf rhymes with "segfault"
