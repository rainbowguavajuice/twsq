<p><b>twsq</b> is a collection of quotes taken from conversations that
happened over the internet: mostly IRC, and later Discord. Some are
attributed to fictional characters. The content was initially hosted
on <a href="https://timey-wimey-squad.tumblr.com">tumblr</a>, before
it was migrated to these pages in early-mid 2020. Updates are
intermittent, and happen whenever someone nearby says something
amusing in or out of context.</p>

<p>If you would no longer like your words to appear on these pages, or
if you would like them attributed to a name other than your handle at
the time the words were spoken, please
<a href="mailto:rainbowguavajuice@gmail.com">write to me</a>.</p>
